<h1 id="header"> Chattanooga Mayoral Election 2021 - What a City Mayor Does</h1>
<p>City Mayor is the executive branch of City government, meaning they have the authority to administrate and 
manage all city level departments. Under the Berke administration, these departments consisted of 
the Economic & Community Development Department, the Police Department, the Fire Department, 
the Public Works Department, the Transportation Department, and the Youth & Family Development Department</p>

<h2> Reorganizing Departments</h2>
<p>One of the Mayor's early duties is to reorganize the departments. This could include splitting department like 
<a href=" https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2013/aug/22/transportation-may-finally-be-getting-attention/116662/">when Mayor Berke created the transportation department out of the public works department</a>. 
The mayor can also add departments, combine existing departments, or remove departments. Several Mayor candidates are pushing for the reinstatiation of the City Parks and Recreation department. </p>

<h2>Appointing Leaders and Advisors</h2>
<p>The mayor also chooses the heads of departments, members of <a href="http://www.chattanooga.gov/boards-commissions">advisory committees</a>, and six other key government leaders 
such as the Police Chief, City Attorney, Fire Chief, Court Clerk, City Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officier. Some candidates in the 2021 mayoral election have already declared whether they would keep or replace the current Police Chief

<h2>Budgeting</h2>
<p>The mayor also creates the budget proposal each year which the city council votes to accept as is or edit through amendments.
The budget is used to provide financial resources to initiatives benefiting our city. The funds are not strictly allocated to city departments.
Under the Berke administration, about 5% of the budget went to support "Agencies" such as CARTA, Signal Center and Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise
