<h1> What a City Mayor Does</h1>
<p>City Mayor is the executive branch of City government, meaning they have the authority to administrate and 
manage all city level departments. Under the Berke administration, these departments consisted of 
the Economic & Community Development Department, the Police Department, the Fire Department, 
the Public Works Department, the Transportation Department, and the Youth & Family Development Department</p>

<h2> Reorganizing Departments</h2>
<p>One of the Mayor's early duties is to reorganize the departments. This could include splitting department like 
<a href=" https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2013/aug/22/transportation-may-finally-be-getting-attention/116662/">when Mayor Berke created the transportation department out of the public works department</a>. 
The mayor can also add departments, combine existing departments, or remove departments. Several Mayor candidates are pushing for the reinstatiation of the City Parks and Recreation department. </p>

<h2>Appointing Leaders and Advisors</h2>
<p>The mayor also chooses the heads of departments, members of <a href="http://www.chattanooga.gov/boards-commissions">advisory committees</a>, and six other key government leaders 
such as the Police Chief, City Attorney, Fire Chief, Court Clerk, City Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officier. Some candidates in the 2021 mayoral election have already declared whether they would keep or replace the current Police Chief 
(<a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/nov/22/chattanoogmayoral-candidates-clash-over-polic/536529/">Read more about mayoral candidates and the police chief</a>)</p>

<h2>Budgeting</h2>
<p>The mayor also creates the budget proposal each year which the city council votes to accept as is or edit through amendments.
The budget is used to provide financial resources to initiatives benefiting our city. The funds are not strictly allocated to city departments.
Under the Berke administration, about 5% of the budget went to support "Agencies" such as CARTA, Signal Center and Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise 
(<a href="https://budget.chattanooga.gov/#!/year/2021/operating/0/service/Agencies/0/department/Agencies/0/program">click here to see other agencies supported in the most recent budget</a>)</p>

These options would include locally licensed childcare centers, preschool centers, and in-home childcare options. The City of Chattanooga would ensure that providers are held to both State and Local standards to make sure that no matter where you live, your child will have access to quality care and early learning. The state government will pick up a high chunk of the cost of operating these new high-quality options to allow local providers to provide access for free to any family that makes less than 20% of the federal poverty line. That means free coverage for thousands of children in Chattanooga. </li> </ul>", "Wade Hinton": "<ul> <li>Develop an early childhood voucher program to assist working families in accessing high-quality early learning programs for children under five.</li> </ul>", "Kim White": "<ul> <li>Along with setting a high priority to create a strong partnership with County and school leaders to see where the City can best serve our public school system, the Cityâ€™s Office of Early Learning will work alongside the Early Matters Coalition, a collection of 40 local organizations leading the way in early childhood education, to significantly increase the number of seats in quality Pre-K and childcare facilities because access and availability of childcare and early learning opportunities is an issue across income levels in our city. In discussions with our local business community, we will advocate for businesses to work alongside working parents to offer childcare options and flexible schedules to keep qualified employees in the workforce. And, the City will lead by example in this regard.</li> </ul>"};
let housing_policies = {"Chris Dahl": "<ul><li>Panic peddling is the illegal practice of inducing people in a neighborhood to sell their homes, by making them believe that members of a minority group are likely to buy property in and around their residential area. The city aides in this by allowing the 'we buy houses' signs being placed in the community and using code enforcement to harass residents.</li></ul>", "D'Angelo Davis": "<ul> <li>My housing plan takes the first step by creating a first of its kind down-payment Rent-to-own assistance program. The people eligible for assistance must be first time homebuyers who live in a formerly redlined neighborhood or community that was segerated by law and are still currently low-income. If they qualify, they are entitled to a substantial grant they can put towards a down payment on a home in a once gentrified or segerated area of Chattanooga. The program will provide thousands of families with a real chance to buy a home. For the rent to own option. This option will be tailored to people who do not meet the credit criteria, or income requirement necessary for first-time homebuyers. These individuals will have a rent agreement for two to three years once completed with no debt added to the family income the mortgage payment would then be entrusted to the individual. </li> <li> Our housing plan will help, by investing $30 million over four years to build, preserve, and rehab affordable housing, creating a multitude of new housing units and bringing down rental costs by 10%. It would also help families, especially families of color, buy homes, and start to build wealth. Substantially improving housing affordability isn't just good for the economy and working families, it will also reduce homelessness and crime. </li> </ul>", "Tim Kelly": "<p>There is no single solution to homelessness â€” instead, it involves an integrated approach designed to break the cycle of homelessness. Our framework consists of practical solutions, including immediate assistance and tools for long-term success. Because every Chattanoogan deserves a home. Our commitment to providing effective solutions for homelessness is centered around five core principles:</p> <ul><li> TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH to reducing the homeless population in Chattanooga.</li> <li> PROVIDE SUPPORTING MEASURES to those who are on the cusp of homelessness.</li> <li>INCREASE the affordable housing supply.</li> <li> BE ETHICAL and inclusive in our values and approach. </li> <li> EMPOWER AND STRENGTHEN the individual to end the cycle of homelessness. </li> </ul> <p>MORE at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kellyforcha.com/blog/homeless-to-housed-a-framework'>kellyforcha.com/blog/homeless-to-housed-a-framework</a></p>", "Chris Long": "<ul> <li> My administration will partner with private enterprise to create the necessary affordable housing for our community. We will create tax incentives for an already overtaxed building sector to provide the affordable housing we desperately need. </li> <li> Currently, by misusing the Federal Consent Decree, the city has overtaxed developers only to take those fees and hide their creative spending in projects dubbed along with projects labeled as necessary to comply with the decree. The result is a beautiful downtown district redeveloped off the backs of her citizens, and a debt that our grandchildren will be struggling to pay off.</li> <li> In order to get a hold of our housing crisis, my administration will first get in line with the consent decree and its proper management of compliance. </li> <li> We will then also pull city building fees and permits back in line, freeing up affordability to the end user home buyers. My administration will create affordable housing to everyone, enabling all our citizens to pursue their version of the American Dream. </li> </ul>", "Wade Hinton": "<ul> <li> Partner with developers and community organizations to create an additional 2,000 affordable housing units and an affordable housing unit tracker, while leveraging smarter housing policies and resources like our Land Bank, housing trust, and a new Housing Commission to ensure more investment in affordable housing over the long-term. </li> </ul>", "Kim White": "<ul><li>With a dedicated housing staff, we will focus on increasing home ownership through better utilizing federal programs, leveraging local nonprofit partners working in this space, and working with local banks to establish a loan pool with support services for first time homeowners. For rental housing, we will create a $2 million dollar affordable housing rental gap fund in my first year with the intention to fund this every year with the goal of creating 700 quality units in my first term. The City currently has 450 back tax properties that we have an opportunity to leverage to increase affordable housing options along with reviewing our current rules and regulations to allow for more affordable housing types to be constructed like accessory dwellings.</li> </ul>", "Monty Bruell": "<p>In order to increase Chattanoogaâ€™s inventory of affordable housing, we will need to deploy a variety of tools.  This isnâ€™t a situation where only 1 or 2 actions will get the job done.  We will need to take a wide variety of actions.  A few of the initiatives I will take are:</p><ul><li>Place select City-owned land into new urban land trusts.  This structure will remove the value of the land itself from the cost of buying homes.  Housing becomes more affordable, because buyers are paying for the house, but not the land.</li><li>Create Tax Increment Finance Districts or TIFs.  By targeting specific geographic areas, incentives can be created for developers of affordable housing units.  Without getting into the technicalities of how TIFs work, let me just say that incremental tax revenues can be used to address development of affordable housing, healthcare facilities, and other economic development opportunities.  I am a former Vice Chairman of the Atlanta Beltline Tax Allocation District Advisory Committee (TADAC), one of the largest affordable housing TIFs in the Southeast (with approximately $1 billion invested in affordable housing developments in metro Atlanta).</li></ul>"};
let public_safety_policies = {"Wade Hinton": "<ul><li> Work with residents, community groups, and our police department, to create a unified approach to public safety by creating a city-wide and neighborhood public safety strategy</li> <li> Prioritize the role social services and other interventions play in public safety to ensure our law enforcement officers do not carry an unfair burden and provide the services Chattanoogans truly need.</li> <li>  Engage community members and expand the impact of the police oversight committee that ensures transparency and builds trust.</li> <li> Communicate ongoing performance data to the public about the status of crime, arrests, department workload, and safety of our officers. </li> <li> Along with other City personnel, evaluate firefighter, police, and emergency services pay to guarantee the City remains competitive for retaining and recruiting high performing talent. </li> <li> Commit to addressing the root causes of crime, ranging from a lack of economic opportunity or to access to mental health services. </li> <li> Work with community stakeholders to create a re-entry strategy to assist individuals released after paying their debt to society.</li></ul>", "Chris Long": "<ul><li>To borrow another candidateâ€™s words, fighting crime is not a social experiment. We donâ€™t need to hire 100 more police officers. We do not need any new ideas on how to handle an old problem. The solution for our city is simple. Enforcement. We cannot tie the hands of law enforcement in this city with even more procedures or rules of engagement. We need to enforce. I will have the back of the police officers of this city. They will have the proper equipment to do their jobs to increase their chances of returning home at night. They will even have batteries for their Tasers that work.</li></ul>", "Kim White": "<ul><li>Public safety is a primary job of any government, and I am committed to the support of our fire and police departments with the resources they need and strong public support. From the beginning of my administration, I will be committed to competitive compensation, additional support services like mental health and addiction treatment specialists to work alongside law enforcement, and to identify and to correct barriers for greater recruitment of minority officers. Regular communication is key, and as Mayor, I will meet regularly with neighborhood leaders and fire and police employee groups to review existing measures, consider new opportunities, and how together, we create a safe Chattanooga for all.</li></ul>", "Erskine Oglesby": "<ul><li> Establish neighborhood watch programs</li> <li> Increase diversity in both Police and Fire Departments</li></ul>", "Monty Bruell": "<ul><li>First and foremost, I am in favor of Chattanooga having a real Citizen Oversight Board with subpoena powers, not just a police advisory committee that makes recommendations to the Chief of Police. Our police force should be accountable to the people of our community. </li><li>Next, I would hire social service and mental health professionals to intervene in situations where citizens are having mental health crises. I would also outsource to private companies functions like traffic accident investigation and other non-violent response calls. For example, both Denver and New Orleans have taken progressive steps in these areas.  Chattanooga should identify and study best practices from across the US.</li><li>Finally, I will address the root causes of crime (e.g. poverty, addiction, etc.). In Chattanooga, our own police department estimates that 65% of burglaries are related to addiction. People are simply stealing things that they can sell to make money to buy drugs. Knowing this, do we invest in rehabilitation and help people kick their addictions? No. We just keep arresting the same poor addicted people over and over again. This does nothing to actually solve the problem.</li></ul>"};
let outdoor_recreation_policies = {"Tim Kelly": "<p> Chattanoogaâ€™s natural assets are at the core of our brand, and outdoor recreation opportunities set us apart from other cities. The Mayorâ€™s commitment to promoting and protecting the regionâ€™s natural beauty and abundant outdoor activities must be unwavering to ensure that residents and visitors alike can enjoy this great asset in perpetuity. Access to the outdoors benefits not just our tourism economy, but more importantly serves as the main driver to promote health, wellness, and quality of life of all Chattanoogans.</p> <p> Our commitment to Chattanoogaâ€™s outdoor recreational ecosystem must include more access for people of color and low-income Chattanoogans. We must account for the barriers that exist for community members and visitors in exploring our regionâ€™s greatest assets and craft a strategy to connect all residents to these resources.</p> <p> Projects undertaken and supported by the City of Chattanooga will strive to meet the following criteria:</p><ul><li>ENCOURAGE INCLUSIVITY and equitable access to the outdoors.</li> <li> PROMOTE KNOWLEDGE of how to explore the outdoors safely.</li> <li> IMPROVE THE USAGE of outdoor assets among locals and visitors.</li> <li> PROTECT outdoor assets.</li> <li> COORDINATE efforts of public, private, and nonprofit organizations.</li></ul><p>MORE at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kellyforcha.com/blog/outdoor-vision-2021'>kellyforcha.com/blog/outdoor-vision-2021</a></p>", "Kim White": "<ul><li>As the outdoors are a major identifier and economic driver for our city, my foremost priority in this regard is to re-establish the Cityâ€™s Parks and Recreation Department to develop and maintain excellent facilities and places for public recreation, sports, and community building; provide dynamic recreation programs and services that promote health and well-being for all; promote and educate environmental sustainability; and ensure the parks, natural areas, public places, and urban forest of the city are accessible to all. Additionally, the creation of a Parks Foundation is a critical next step to strategically invest in our limited and valuable public space that will enable us to raise private dollars, give us flexibility with park programming, and allow for more neighborhood focused park projects. </li></ul>"};

Also have a small police precincts added to them to allow funding to be invested from the police department into the community. </li></ul>", "Monty Bruell": "<ul><li>The entire Youth and Family Development system needs to be overhauled.  First, we need to greatly increase the programs and funding for Early Childhood Development.  I have already been involved in conversations with the Pritzker Family Foundation in Chicago to explore a potential partnership with Chattanooga.  Early Childhood Development is the top priority of this progressive foundation.</li><li>Next, we have to return to a focus on recreation.  Our kids will do better academically, if we give them outlets for exercise and recreation.  How can the Best Outdoor City Ever close its rec centers on weekends and not provide outdoor activities for kids?</li><li>Finally, our YFD centers should be hubs for the entire communities that they serve.  We have to use these facilities to provide engagement opportunities with seniors, workforce development and job skills training for adults, as well as pop up healthcare services.

We must focus on making sure our neighborhoods have a great infrastructure and great quality of life.</p> <ul><li> Empower neighborhoods to reimagine how YFD centers should be used in their community, and increase investment in YFD centers. </li> <li> Revive our neighborhood parks and build a department dedicated to parks and the outdoors. </li> <li> Work with city planners, developers and other stakeholders to ensure broad access to housing for all.</li> <li> Expand grant opportunities for neighborhood associations and work with private partners to develop opportunities for public art and beautification investment in neighborhoods. </li> <li> Invest in neighborhoods, from playground equipment to sidewalks, to enhance the quality of life for all Chattanoogans.</li></ul>", "Monty Bruell": "<ul><li>It is true that we have developed a vibrant Downtown, Riverfront, and Innovation District.

Simply bringing in new relocated corporate industries has proven to be a disappointment to most in our city. We will provide the financial tools for small businesses to recover from the financial downturn that they have suffered, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many huge corporations have literally thrived in our community through COVID-19 restrictions, tax abatements, and sweetheart deals. However, our small businesses have largely withered. By providing the economic climate and opportunity for small businesses, our citizens can once again get on the path to the American Dream. I believe that it is not the governmentâ€™s job to provide the direct economic solution for everyone, but to set the economic climate and primer for everyone to succeed. New, good paying jobs are literally the economic engine of our city and will be the catalyst that everyone needs to provide the quality of life that we all desire. </li></ul>", "Kim White": "<ul><li>With a focus on small and medium sized businesses, at the outset of my administration I will create an Office of Small Business Support to assist those businesses in accessing available City or community resources, in navigating City government like permitting, and harnessing any and all funds for pandemic recovery. And while recruiting companies to Chattanooga is a key piece of the jobs puzzle along with strong partnerships with the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Hamilton County officials, and the Chamber of Commerce, we will also work with partners with UTC and Chattanooga State who are key in providing necessary education and training for Chattanoogans to access these jobs. With a renewed focus on job recruitment and workforce training, the key is to bring these services and the services of the Office of Small Business Support into neighborhoods and not behind the doors of City Hall.</li></ul>", "Tim Kelly": "<p>In order to recover, we must have a plan to get on the right track. Chattanooga has the potential to emerge stronger than ever from this pandemic, but it wonâ€™t happen without the right leadership. </p> <ul><li>  Immediately implement common-sense testing and tracing protocols to keep our economy open and thriving. </li> <li> Completely realign how City government operates and remove barriers so that all businesses in Chattanooga can access the resources they need to succeed and grow.  </li> <li> Realign the City budget to make sure dollars are invested in the areas that are most critical for expanding our economy and improving quality of life.  </li> <li> Invest in small and diverse businesses.  </li> <li> Invest in workforce development opportunities that make sense for all Chattanoogans. </li> <li> Incentivize workforce training to prepare our community for the next generation of jobs.  </li> <li> Mitigate reliance on the tourism economy by investing in homegrown entrepreneurship. </li> <li> Leverage our gigabit infrastructure and natural assets to recruit diverse businesses.  </li> <li> Implement a sustainable and livable wage for city employees. </li> </ul>", "Monty Bruell": "<h4>Economic Development</h4> <ul><li>The majority of jobs in the US are created by small business, yet our state and local governments spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tax breaks and incentives for huge corporations. Some of these breaks are justified, but many are not. At the local level, our city government should be focused on helping small businesses thrive and prosper. Dollars earned locally are spent locally. We need to cut red tape and consolidate business services of Hamilton County and the City of Chattanooga.</li></ul> <h4>COVID-19 Recovery</h4> <ul><li>As vaccines for COVID-19 continue to be developed and made available to the public, it is now time for us to focus on rebuilding and making whole again the families and small businesses that have been ravaged by this pandemic.  Too many owners have lost their businesses and workers have lost their jobs.  I will create a recovery plan with financial institutions, small businesses, and state and local governments to provide pathways to economic and community revitalization.  One good thing that has come out of the COVID-19 crisis, is that we have learned how great our capacity is to come to the aid of our neighbors and help one another.</li></ul>"};

We will identify low-hanging fruit on which we can all agree.  Together we will lobby the Governor and State Legislature to enact legislation that will make our cities more sustainable.  Because collectively we represent 65% of Tennesseeâ€™s total population, this Mayors Council should be a formidable and persuasive political force.</li><li>Letâ€™s study best practices from across the country and around the world. Two initiatives that come to mind are Sustainable DC 2.0 in Washington, DC and P4 Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, PA.  Our focus should be on developing public policies that best support people, families, and neighborhoods.</li><li>Chattanooga sits right in the middle of NASA, Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Georgia Tech, and Vanderbilt.
